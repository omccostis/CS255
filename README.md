# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project involved desinging a system for DriverPass, a driver training company that wanted a web-based platform which allows students to take online practice tests, schedule on-the-road driving lessons, and track their progress. The system needed to properly hamdle user data, lesson scheduling, activity reporting, and DMV updates.

# What did you do particularly well?
I think I was most effective at simplifying and organizing the system design in a way that makes it easy to understand for a nontechnical audience.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would refine the layout of my Use Case diagram to better group similar or shared functions together, which would make the relationships between actors clearer.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I took notes as I carefully reviewed the interview transcript and listed requirements so that I had all the required details in a single location to reference while creating my system design. Considering user needs is important because if it is not intuitive, secure, and useful, the user experience will suffer and it is likely that users will not enjoy the product.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Ensuring that I have a full understanding of the client's needs and business goals before thinking about technical details will be my first step in system design going forward, because it creates the opportunity to ask for more details if anything is missing or unclear. This will ensure my final design complies with the system requirements and meets client expectations.
